# Music Genre Classification 🎶

This project aims to classify songs into different musical genres using **Deep Learning**. It implements a **Neural Network** architecture to process audio data and achieve accurate classification.

## 📌 Description
In this project, **CNNs**, and **MLP** neural networks are used to classify musical genres from audio files. The dataset is processed by extracting features using **MFCCs** (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) with the **Librosa** library.

## 🚀 Technologies
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- **Librosa** for audio processing
- **CNNs, DNN, MLP** as neural network architectures

## 📝 Features
- Audio signal processing
- Comparison of different neural network models
- Feature extraction using MFCCs
- Classification of songs into genres like pop, rock, jazz, etc.

## 📊 Dataset
The **GTZAN** dataset was used, which includes audio samples from various musical genres.

## 🔍 Models Used
- **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**: Basic neural network model used as a baseline.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Model used to capture spatial patterns in the extracted features.
  
## 📈 Results
The accuracies of different models were compared to evaluate which one is best suited for music genre classification.
