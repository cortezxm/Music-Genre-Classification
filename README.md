# Music-Genre-Classification
Music genre classification project using neural networks. It applies advanced audio recognition techniques such as MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and employs CNN and DNN models with TensorFlow and the Librosa library for feature extraction. The results are compared between an MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and a CNN.
